Squad does does one thing: Shows the real time location of your friends. That's it. You go to the site, make a new "room" and send a short link to your friends. A map indicating where you and your friends are. Its that simple, now you can easily find each other. No apps, no downloads.

Some things are still wonky, but we are working on it!
